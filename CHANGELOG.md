# fx

## 0.8.2

<!-- release:start -->
### Bug Fixes

- **A held change names the gate and the file:** a tool call a gate held now reads `Held · SDD TDD` with the file it was about to touch, instead of only the word for the kind of target.
- **A memory note can no longer outrank the configuration:** fx now also checks facts that are edited in place, and holds a fact that records how fx itself behaves or whether a mode, gate or feature is on. The effective configuration is the only source for that.
- **The gate says what is still allowed while it holds a change:** the test-first hold now states that writing the spec or the change doc first is fine, and that a test reading source files as text for strings or class names does not cover behavior.

### Improvements

- **fx states the effective SDD/TDD mode every turn:** each turn carries one line with the workspace's live SDD and TDD mode, what that mode asks for (test-first for behavior, the running app for presentation), and that the configuration wins over any memory fact.
- **Memory guidance names what each fact is worth:** `feedback` facts are how the user wants you to work and are followed unless the current request says otherwise; the other kinds stay background to verify before relying on them.
<!-- release:end -->

## 0.8.1

### Bug Fixes

- **Presentation changes are not asked for tests:** When fx classifies a change as only how something looks, it no longer asks to tighten tests at the end of the turn. Such a change is checked in the running app instead.
- **A turn attaches to the newest relevant change:** When a turn does not name an SDD change, fx now uses the most recently approved one instead of the oldest, so a stale approved change no longer captures unrelated work.

## 0.8.0

**fx no longer checks the interface with Iris.**

### Breaking Changes

- **No more Iris visual check:** The after-turn screenshot check is gone, along with the `jev.gates.visual` and `jev.visual.model` settings and the per-project `workspaces["<path>"].iris` switch. `fx jev iris on|off`, `/jev iris on|off` and `fx jev eval visual` are no longer accepted, and `fx jev full` now adds only the plan and drift checks. Settings that still carry the old keys keep working; fx ignores them.

## 0.7.0

**fx lite: Jev now only steps in where it saves time, so turns finish faster.**

### Breaking Changes

- **No more completion re-checks:** fx no longer sends the agent back after its answer to prove each claim. The "this turn's tool results do not back the answer yet" retry, the receipts file and the `jev.gates.stop` and `jev.thresholds.stop` settings are gone.
- **No automatic checkpoint commits:** fx no longer commits earlier work before a separate request. `jev.gates.checkpoint` is gone; commit when you choose to.
- **No pull request review gate:** `gh pr create` and `gh pr ready` run without a held review. `jev.gates.review` is gone.
- **TDD is off by default:** New workspaces use `tdd: off`. Workspaces that saved a mode keep it; `fx sdd tdd auto` turns Jev's per-request choice back on.

### New Features

- **Jev modes:** `fx jev lite` (the default) keeps the checks that save a model round: answering settled questions, SDD routing, safer edits and memory. `fx jev full` adds the plan, drift and Iris checks. `/jev lite` and `/jev full` work inside a session, and `FX_JEV_MODE` overrides the saved mode.
- **Iris per project:** `fx jev iris on|off` (or `/jev iris on|off`) turns the screenshot check on or off for the current workspace only.
- **Unbacked test claims:** When the answer says the tests pass but no passing test run follows the last code change, fx shows one line under the answer. No model is called and the agent is not sent back.

### Improvements

- **Fewer failed shell calls:** Fields such as `timeout_ms` sent next to `request` instead of inside it now run instead of failing. A `yield_time_ms` above 30 seconds is capped, and a `shell` choice without a terminal falls back to the default shell. Each of these used to cost a model round.
## 0.6.0

**Jev now decides more of the work: when a change needs a test first, when to commit, when a pull request needs a review, and what to remember.**

### New Features

- **StepFun provider:** `STEPFUN_API_KEY` connects fx to StepFun with `step-5-preview` (1M-token context, images), `step-3.7-flash`, `step-3.5-flash` and `step-3.5-flash-2603`, all with tools and reasoning levels `low`, `medium` and `high`.
- **Workspace memory:** fx keeps facts across sessions for each workspace in `~/.fx/memory/`, one markdown file per fact plus a `MEMORY.md` index the agent sees on every request. Jev skips facts the repository already records and asks to update a fact instead of saving a near-duplicate. Turn it off with `"memory": {"enabled": false}` or `FX_MEMORY=off`.
- **Automatic checkpoint commits:** When a new request is separate from earlier uncommitted work and the tests passed on that exact code, fx has the agent commit only the files the earlier work touched before it starts. It never commits on the default branch and never stages your unrelated edits. Turn it off with `jev.gates.checkpoint`.
- **Pull request review by risk:** Before `gh pr create` or `gh pr ready`, Jev rates the branch's risk. Risky changes such as permissions, money, data deletion or migrations get a full review of the diff and a `## Review` section in the pull request. Turn it off with `jev.gates.review`.
- **Visual check with Iris:** When a turn changes the UI and Iris is registered as an MCP server, the agent takes a screenshot and compares it with the request before finishing. Without Iris, fx says once that the check was skipped. Turn it off with `jev.gates.visual`.

### Improvements

- **Test-first only when it helps:** The new default `tdd: auto` lets Jev decide. Behavior changes and bug fixes stay test-first; presentation and trivial changes skip the failing-test step but still need passing tests. A `(manual)` marker added mid-turn now takes effect right away.
- **Completion claims stay backed:** fx records test and build runs together with the code they ran on, so "tests pass" from an earlier turn counts until the code changes, and a failing run never backs a green claim.
- **Spec or code:** When the code contradicts a spec, Jev decides which side is wrong. Changes you asked for update the spec, accidental changes are undone in the code, and unclear cases are asked to you.
- **Safer edits:** Targeted edits made with `sed -i`, `perl -pi` or inline scripts are steered to `edit_file`, whose exact matching keeps files from breaking silently. Bulk renames you ask for still run.
- **One plan, not two:** When a plan adds or misses steps, the agent replies with only the amendment instead of writing the whole plan again.

### Bug Fixes

- **Unknown tool names:** A turn no longer stops with `InvalidToolName` when the model names a tool that does not exist. The model is told the tool is unsupported and continues.
- **StepFun tool calls:** Tool call arguments streamed by StepFun are no longer cut short.

### Security

- **Memory paths as data:** Workspace paths and memory index lines are encoded before they reach the model, so a crafted directory name cannot inject instructions.

## 0.5.0


**Close a finished SDD change by saying "ok", and get one answer per turn instead of two.**

### New Features

- **Close in plain language:** When every task of an approved change is ticked, the agent shows what it did and asks you to review it. Replying "ok perfecto" or "está bien, abrí la PR" closes the change, the same way "sí" approves one. `/sdd done` still works.

### Improvements

- **Status changes reach the agent:** After you run `/sdd approve` or `/sdd done`, the agent learns the new status on its next turn, so it no longer tells you a closed change is still open.
- **Specs in the same answer:** The agent writes the spec rules and asks for review before its final answer, instead of answering and then summarizing everything again.
- **Shorter corrections:** When Jev's completion check or a TDD or drift check sends the agent back, it replies with only the correction instead of repeating its whole answer.
- **Fewer rechecks:** Jev's completion check no longer asks for proof of work from earlier turns, and telling the agent that a pull request was merged needs only an acknowledgement.
- **Clear notices:** Checks that send the agent back show as a short `↻` line from fx, separate from the agent's text.
- **`fx jev eval close`:** Runs labeled cases for the close check.

### Bug Fixes

- **The right change:** With several approved changes, fx follows the one the turn is about instead of the first one on disk.

## 0.4.0


**fx now connects to Meta's Muse models.**

### New Features

- **Meta Muse provider:** `fx login muse` or `MUSE_API_KEY` connects fx to the Meta Model API with `muse-spark-1.3` (also `muse-spark-1.3-contributor`), including tools, images, a 1M-token context and reasoning levels from `low` to `max`.

## 0.3.3


**Turns no longer stop when a model sends broken tool arguments.**

### Bug Fixes

- **Broken tool arguments:** With OpenAI-compatible providers such as DeepSeek, a tool call whose arguments are not valid JSON no longer ends the turn with `request failed: InvalidToolArguments`. fx skips that call, tells the model what was wrong so it can retry, and still runs the other calls in the same step. Saved sessions that contain such a call keep working.

## 0.3.2


**Spec-driven development gets out of the way when you ship: opening a PR no longer asks for a proposal, and your "yes" always counts.**

### Improvements

- **Setup guide:** The README now walks through setting up fx in five steps (provider and model, permissions, `AGENTS.md`, Jev, SDD and TDD) and lists where each setting lives and which variable overrides it.

### Bug Fixes

- **Shipping is not a change:** Committing, pushing, opening a PR or writing release notes goes straight through, and files written outside the project (such as a PR body in `/tmp`) are never held.
- **Approvals in any turn:** A reply such as "si yes" approves the pending proposal even when that turn only pushes or opens a PR, and a "yes" with extra instructions still counts.
- **The right proposal:** With several proposals open, fx approves the one your reply names, or the newest.
- **Bugs versus tweaks:** Changing how something looks or adding a filter is no longer treated as a bug, so test-first mode does not ask for a regression test.

## 0.3.1


**Smoother spec-driven development: fewer interruptions while a change waits for your approval, and specs that fill in as changes land.**

### Improvements

- **Specs grow with each change:** After the first code change under an approved change, the agent ticks the change's tasks and writes the behavior it added as rules in `sdd/specs`. `/sdd done` also points out when there are no rules yet.
- **Held, not failed:** Calls a Jev or SDD check holds now show as "Held" in the transcript instead of "Failed".
- **Jev status:** `fx jev` and `/jev` list the SDD routing and test-first checks.

### Bug Fixes

- **Waiting for approval:** A turn that stops to ask you to approve a change, or to ask you anything, is no longer sent back by the completion check.
- **Proposals need no plan:** Writing a proposal or spec under `sdd/` is no longer held for a plan.
- **Approval stays yours:** When the agent runs `fx sdd approve` or `fx sdd done` itself, fx holds the command; your reply approves the change, and you close it with `/sdd done`.

## 0.3.0


**fx now runs a lightweight spec-driven development process when you want it: specs that describe how the system behaves today, one file per change, and Jev deciding how much process each request needs.**

### New Features

- **SDD per workspace:** `fx sdd on` and `fx sdd off`, or `/sdd on` and `/sdd off` in a session, switch the process for the current workspace. It is off by default, so fx works freely until you turn it on, and the status line shows `sdd` while it is on. `FX_SDD=on|off` overrides the saved setting for one shell.
- **Specs and changes:** `sdd/specs/<name>.md` holds current behavior, one rule per `## ` heading. Each change is one file in `sdd/changes`, created with `fx sdd new <slug>` and moved through `fx sdd approve` and `fx sdd done`. `fx sdd` shows the specs, open changes and task progress.
- **Right-sized process:** With Jev on, the first code change of a request is sorted into a fix (goes straight through), a spec update (the agent updates the affected rules in the same change) or a change (code waits until a change file is approved). Vague requests come back as a question, and "no hagas propuesta" or "skip the spec" keeps it a fix.
- **Approve by replying:** A reply such as "sí, aprobado" approves the proposed change, and the agent goes on to implement it.
- **Test-first:** `fx sdd tdd on` makes behavior changes and bug fixes start with a failing test and end with a passing run, and Jev checks that the new tests would fail without the requested behavior. `fx sdd tdd strict` also asks for every changed rule to be cited by a test, and `fx sdd` reports that coverage. Rules marked `(manual)` are checked in the running app instead.
- **Rule-by-rule drift:** The spec drift check compares each rule in `sdd/specs` with the changed code on its own and asks the agent to rewrite the rules the code now contradicts. It runs automatically only while SDD is on; `fx jev drift` still runs on demand.
- **Growth check:** A fix or spec update that spreads past 8 source files pauses once so the agent can propose a change instead.
- **Routing calibration:** `fx jev eval sdd` runs labeled requests through the same routing to check it before you rely on it.

### Bug Fixes

- **Completion check:** A final answer that claims tests pass while the test output shows failures is no longer excused as a reported blocker.

## 0.2.0


**This fork is `fx` again, and Jev now checks the agent's decisions: plans before large changes, verified answers, settled questions, subagent routing and decision records that stay in sync with the code.**

### Breaking Changes

- **Name:** The binary, profile and variables are `fx`, `~/.fx`, `.fx.json` and `FX_*` again. Move `~/.abc` to `~/.fx`; keys saved under the old name move automatically the first time they are used. `abc update` cannot install this release; reinstall with the install script.

### New Features

- **Jev decisions:** `fx jev key`, `fx jev on` and `fx jev check` connect Jev, TypeSafe AI's decision model. `/jev` shows or switches it inside a session.
- **Completion check:** Before a turn ends, Jev checks that the final answer is backed by the turn's tool results; otherwise the agent verifies before answering again.
- **Plan before changes:** The first file change of a substantial request waits until the agent states a plan that covers it.
- **Settled questions:** Jev answers the agent's multiple-choice questions only when the request or the agent's findings already settle them.
- **Living decision records:** `fx jev drift` flags decision records a diff contradicts, and after each turn that changes files the agent is asked to update the records it made out of date.
- **Subagent routing:** `jev.routing` lets Jev pick a model for each temporary subagent.
- **Action check:** Optional `gates.action` holds file changes and commands that look off-task or damaging in ways the user did not ask for.
- **Calibration:** `fx jev eval` runs labeled cases through the same checks to confirm thresholds and models.

### Bug Fixes

- **Subagent results:** Subagents no longer return an empty result when a completion hook is active.

## 0.0.11

**fx now supports custom model connections and themes. Resume, file lookup and request handling are up to 100× faster, long turns use 17× less memory, and libfx adds steering, images, web search and model controls.**

### Breaking Changes

- **Automatic recovery:** `/continue` has been removed. fx now retries and continues on its own.

### New Features

- **Default model:** fx now uses Grok 4.7 as its default model. Fast mode remains opt-in.
- **Custom connections:** fx now supports named OpenAI Chat Completions connections for local servers and other gateways. Configure them in `~/.fx/settings.json`, then select one with `fx provider <name>` or `FX_PROVIDER`.
- **Provider routing:** Gateway users can set `provider_order` and `provider_strict`, or pass `--provider-order` and `--provider-strict`, to prefer or restrict which providers serve a model.
- **Interactive flags:** Interactive sessions accept `--provider`, `--model`, `--effort`, and `--fast`; `fx ask` accepts `--model`, `--effort`, and `--fast` for one run without changing saved preferences. Grok models now support Fast mode.
- **Slack bot:** fx can now install and manage your Slack workspace bot from the CLI.
- **Custom themes:** fx now loads custom TUI themes from `~/.fx/themes/<name>.json`, including VS Code themes. Set `theme` in `~/.fx/settings.json` or use `FX_THEME`.
- **Image reading:** `read_file` now attaches PNG, JPEG, GIF, and WebP files to supported vision models.
- **libfx steering:** libfx turns support `turn.steer()` for mid-turn guidance. Applied steering arrives as a `user_message` event and remains in checkpoints.
- **libfx model controls:** `createFxAgent()` now accepts image blocks plus `effort` and `fast` options. libfx now supports `web_search`.
- **libfx activity:** libfx hosts receive `transport.activity` while responses stream, and `tool_start` now includes tool input or a bounded preview.
- **libfx tool boundaries:** libfx now keeps host tools separate from fx's built-in tools, even when they share a name.

### Improvements

- **Recovery:** Transient model failures now retry until the connection recovers. Silent streams use liveness checks, and retries slow to once a minute after 15 minutes.
- **Session resume:** `/resume` opens up to 60× faster with better session caching.
- **File suggestions:** `@` file suggestions are 6–40× faster with a saved index and background scanning.
- **Gateway setup:** Gateway connection setup is up to 48× faster by warming and reusing connections across turns.
- **Usage tracking:** Usage tracking is over 100× faster on large local histories.
- **Memory use:** Long tool-heavy turns use over 17× less memory in the release benchmark.
- **Compaction:** Compaction now preserves conversation history more accurately for better continuation afterward.
- **Syntax highlighting:** Shell commands and code blocks now have better syntax highlighting across more languages.
- **MCP errors:** MCP now shows clearer startup and authentication errors, including what to do next.
- **MCP forms:** Small MCP forms with one choice and up to three options submit directly from the terminal prompt.
- **Diagnostics:** Logs in `/trace` and `ctrl+o` are cleaner and more useful for diagnosing session issues.
- **Subagents:** Subagent rows show the child's model, effort, token use, and task status. Exact and unambiguous partial model names now work in subagent overrides.
- **Faster exits:** Double `Ctrl+C` exits up to 40× faster when MCP servers are stuck, and no longer waits on upgrade downloads.
- **Command rendering:** Command rows now resize with the terminal, giving long shell commands cleaner rendering.

### Bug Fixes

- **Multiple images:** Reading multiple images in one turn no longer crashes fx, and images returned by tools now reach vision models through Gateway.
- **Image accounting:** Tool images no longer count as text during request estimation. Automatic compaction now uses the real image cost.
- **Session titles:** Resuming an untitled session now generates a title from its first committed prompt instead of preserving `Untitled session`.
- **Session saving:** A completed turn that fails to save no longer exits fx. The response stays in memory and the save error remains visible.
- **Workspace search:** `grep_files` and `glob_files` no longer end an otherwise completed turn when searching from the workspace root.
- **Full-screen views:** Typing while `ctrl+o` or another full-screen view is open no longer disturbs the main conversation. Queued prompt previews also stay clear of active transcript rows.
- **Tool recovery:** Tool failures now name the unresolved path and tell the model when to reread a file or choose another approach instead of retrying blindly.
- **Cancelled recovery:** Cancelling response recovery no longer revives the stopped turn on resume. After restarting, the model is also told that old background shell sessions no longer exist.
- **MCP capabilities:** MCP resources and prompts no longer fail the whole tool call when a server never advertised that capability.
- **MCP authentication:** Rejected or expired MCP credentials now show `needs_auth` and the right re-authentication command instead of appearing authenticated.
- **Terminal resume:** Resumed terminal rows show the recorded launch command, including after moving the workspace, instead of raw session IDs or fixed-width text.
- **Transcript retention:** Transcript retention no longer overwrites finalized conversation rows or loses pending rows during resize and full-transcript viewing.
- **Fast mode fallback:** When the model catalog is unavailable, fx reports that the requested Fast mode could not be enabled and continues normally.
- **Steering recovery:** Steering and response recovery no longer lose buffered assistant output or completed turn summaries.

### Security

- **Custom connection credentials:** Custom connections read credentials only from their named environment variable, and committed project configuration cannot define model endpoints. Saved sessions refuse to resume against a changed endpoint or authentication identity.
- **Review model:** Set `review_model` or `FX_REVIEW_MODEL` to choose the model used for auto-mode safety reviews. Review transport failures and malformed replies retry once; cautions never retry for approval, and an unresolved action stays blocked.
- **Safe tool errors:** Tool failure details now redact secrets and escape terminal control sequences before rendering.


## 0.0.10

**fx now completes turns up to 1.6× faster and starts model requests up to 2.5× faster.**

### Improvements

- Speed gains vary with session length and usage. Longer sessions improve the most.
- Shell failures now give the model clearer recovery guidance.
- `/trace` now provides better diagnostics for session-title issues.
- System notices have a cleaner visual treatment.

### Bug Fixes

- Resume recovery now restores shell activity more reliably.
- Scrollback retention is more reliable when resuming long conversations.
- Resolved questions and answers now render cleanly across terminal widths.

### Security

- MCP errors now have stronger secret protection.

## 0.0.9

**fx can now use a frontier model for steering, then delegate to cheaper models to implement. Subagents keep running while you steer, can have different models and reasoning levels, and take feedback mid-task. We're accomplishing this without any new commands or concepts, just chat with fx.**

### Breaking Changes

- For simplicity, `!` in the composer is just prompt text now. It no longer starts a terminal session. Commands go through the agent and the usual approval flow.

### New Features

- Subagents can use their own model and reasoning effort. Use GPT-6, Astra, or Fable 5.1 to steer, then delegate implementation to Kimi K3.
- You can send feedback to a running named subagent without interrupting its current tool. The final result still comes back to the parent conversation.
- New conversations get a short title from the first prompt. Turn generated session titles off in `/settings`.
- Press `ctrl+p` while writing to open the model picker. Your draft and attached images stay where they are.
- ACP clients can set reasoning effort on supported models. They can also replay earlier tool calls as structured events.
- New runnable `libfx` examples for [Node.js](https://fx-demo-node-chat.vercel.app/), [browsers](https://fx-demo-browser-agent.vercel.app/), [Next.js](https://fx-demo-nextjs-agent.vercel.app/), and [Nuxt](https://fx-demo-nuxt-agent.vercel.app/).

### Improvements

- `fx -c` and `fx --continue` now resume the workspace’s remembered conversation without a full session scan.
- Compaction now shows in the activity row. If you send a message while it's running, it waits, then runs with the compacted context.
- Assistant Markdown now renders nested emphasis, links, code spans, lists, fenced code blocks, and entities the way GitHub does.
- `@~`, `@.`, and `@..` open the home directory, workspace, and parent directory. No trailing slash needed. File suggestions also stay put while you browse and refine them.
- Escape needs a second press within one second to interrupt active work. ctrl+c clears a non-empty composer first; with an empty composer, it interrupts active work, then exits fx on the next press.

### Bug Fixes

- Running subagents keep going if a file lookup fails. Follow-up messages also don't leave named subagents stuck.
- AI Gateway now applies the reasoning effort you selected on chat requests. Prompts with images no longer fail on the v4 endpoint.
- Long replies no longer shuffle transcript rows or overwrite the last character on a full-width terminal line.
- MCP OAuth now works with servers that support PKCE but leave `none` out of their metadata, including Slack MCP.

### Security

- Auto mode now checks which terminal session it's sending input to, including after a resume.
- Auto mode no longer reuses an earlier safety-review decision when judging a later action.
- Auto mode no longer raises false cautions when you use a credential with the service it's for, or with a local test process.

## 0.0.8

**fx is smaller, simpler, and faster. libfx initialization in Node / browser is over 40× faster; fx binary is 7.49% smaller. fx uses a smaller three-action shell, context compaction is optimized per model, and Enter steers active turns instead of queuing follow-ups.**

### Breaking Changes

- fx now uses a smaller shell tool with 75% fewer actions (3 vs 12), replacing the old terminal tool.
- Enter now steers active turns instead of queuing follow-ups, and ctrl+enter does the same.
- The subagent interface now has 67% fewer commands (2 vs 6), with direct delegation replacing the ctrl+x manager.
- The memory tool has been removed without deleting existing saved memories.
- createFxAgent() now exposes prompt, checkpoint, and close instead of the old session, model, and config APIs.
- createFxAgent() now takes apiKey and an optional model directly; Agent configuration through env is no longer accepted.
- capability_search replaces the retired skill_search and mcp_search_tools.
- The public --record startup flag has been removed.

### New Features

- Compaction now keeps recent tool exchanges intact, preserves the full transcript, and continues the same turn in a fresh context window.
- fx can run one-off tasks or continue named agents directly from the conversation.
- The shell now supports up to 64 live executions.
- /mcp now opens a terminal browser for servers, tools, resources, prompts, authentication, and project trust.
- MCP tool images now reach supported models and remain available after resume.
- JavaScript hosts can now add their own tools, MCP clients, and skills across Node, Bun, and browsers.
- The libfx package has no runtime dependencies; host-supplied tools and MCP clients may have their own.
- ACP image prompts now support up to 3.75 MiB per image.
- /provider, /setup, and /login now open the same column picker for providers, sign-in methods, API keys, and Vercel teams.
- libfx now provides listModels() for explicit model discovery without creating an Agent.
- Embedding hosts can use FX_AUTH_MODE=host-managed without reading or writing local provider credentials.
- --full-access and /permissions full-access replace YOLO in the UI and commands; the old aliases still work.
- fx ask --json now reports input and output tokens.

- libfx now supports both ESM imports and CommonJS `require()` in Node.
- Native libfx Agents now run in Next.js 15 and 16 server routes without extra bundler configuration.
- `getBackendInfo()` now reports available libfx backends and loading errors without creating an Agent.
- `fx session recover <id>` can recover damaged conversations into a new session while leaving the original intact.

### Improvements

- Native Agent initialization is tens of times faster, dropping from hundreds of milliseconds to single digits.
- Native streaming no longer waits on the polling bridge.
- Synthetic native host-tool round trips measured 3.10 ms in Node and 1.56 ms in Bun at p95.
- In the current benchmark, all 22 measured TUI interactions complete within 15 ms at p95 across 50 samples each.
- CLI startup now takes about 0.5 ms before terminal initialization.
- ctrl+o now shows timestamps, complete tool details, errors, and per-turn token usage in one view.
- Skill and MCP searches now reject weak matches while preserving exact names and technical terms.
- AI Gateway now uses Exa by default for web searches, with Parallel as the fallback.
- AI Gateway caching is now enabled automatically for agent conversations.
- New sessions use shorter 12-character IDs while existing IDs remain resumable.
- File and model pickers remain available while fx is working, and model changes apply to the next turn.
- Steering messages now appear in chat immediately and wait only while a tool is running.
- Codex and Grok model lists refresh in open terminal and ACP sessions without requiring their CLIs.
- Stable Wasm sources compile once per JavaScript realm while each Agent keeps separate state and memory.
- MCP servers now connect independently, and optional servers start only when needed.
- Subagent tasks and replies now appear in chat, with failures and partial results preserved.
- The /resume picker now reuses cached session summaries instead of rescanning every time.
- Terminal tabs now show the fx version and workspace folder.
- libfx now pauses large streams when hosts fall behind instead of losing output.
- ctrl+c now clears the composer first and cancels active work only when the composer is empty.

- Long saved conversations now resume faster, including repeated `fx -c` continuation.
- Scoped project instructions now refresh before continued turns, including rules changed since the last tool call.

### Bug Fixes

- Models with native image support no longer receive the redundant vision tool.
- Terminal fx ask now loads approved MCP servers before the first model request.
- The footer now shows Fast mode only when it matches the active model.
- fx now keeps replies in the language of the latest user request.
- AI Gateway requests can run for up to 30 minutes, and timed-out streams pause instead of retrying automatically.
- Partial command output and known process status are preserved when output reading fails.
- Forced shell termination now stops waiting after 6 seconds and reports when termination cannot be confirmed.
- Tools that fail before execution now show why they did not run.
- Cancelling an ACP prompt now stops the work instead of leaving it running.
- Gateway, Codex, and Grok no longer fall back to another credential source when the selected one is unavailable.
- New sessions remain saved when another fx process is updating session history.
- Older sessions now upgrade without losing conversation history or tool output.
- Explicitly requested skills now load completely and show their status before the reply begins.
- Cancellation feedback now appears immediately after esc, while completed tool results remain intact.
- Invalid shell requests now explain the argument problem and suggest a correction only when the repair is unambiguous.
- Recovered responses no longer join text from separate attempts or repeat completed tool calls.
- Provider selection remains responsive while credentials and models load, and sign-in can resume after logout, cancellation, or credential failures.
- Large session reads no longer block concurrent saves.
- Cancelled libfx prompts stop waiting on host tools and cannot affect later turns.
- Native streaming preserves Unicode split across output chunks and continues after delayed cleanup.
- Closed libfx Agents now release native threads, notification descriptors, and Wasm instances.
- Pending MCP authentication no longer blocks a newer reload.
- ctrl+o history now survives ctrl+l, terminal resizing, reopening, compaction, and resume without missing or duplicate entries.
- Provider streams and parallel tool calls no longer lose or duplicate text, reasoning, and tool results.
- Prompt images now survive tool calls and resume without falsely exhausting context.

- Image recovery now uses saved attachments after restart, even if the original files move or change.
- Missing or corrupt saved images now report an error without discarding the pending request.
- Manual compaction now refreshes the selected login and keeps the conversation unchanged if sign-in fails.
- Cancelled tools no longer prevent manual or automatic compaction, including after resume.
- Long reasoning sessions no longer hit false context limits or leave too little room for compaction.
- `fx -c` now skips incomplete sessions and reports errors for the selected session instead of opening an older conversation.
- Missing or incompatible usage data no longer blocks valid conversations from resuming; unavailable historical totals are marked explicitly.
- Session recovery now handles corrupt usage data and reports unreadable saved state instead of claiming no repair is needed.
- Suspending fx with `Ctrl+Z` now keeps the session locked, preventing another process from changing it before foregrounding.
- Failed session writes preserve existing history and pause work when saving cannot be confirmed.
- Completed turns remain saved after rendering failures, and save failures on exit now return an error.
- Multiline steering around tool completion no longer crashes fx or loses the submitted message.
- Web searches no longer fail when the model restarts its streamed reply after a tool call.
- Failed or interrupted subagents no longer appear as successful empty replies.
- libfx checkpoints now preserve reasoning and provider tool results, including responses without visible text.
- Promised Wasm assets now load correctly in Node, and CommonJS deployments retain their native addon.
- Embedded terminals now clean up after startup failures and cancel pending requests when output fails.
- Credential recovery guidance now names the selected source and explains how to repair it.

### Security

- Auto mode now reviews the exact pending action and no longer warns on benign work because command text appeared in tool output.
- Symbolic credential references remain reviewable, while literal values stay masked and blocked.
- ACP requests must target the active session, and managed child sessions stay private to their parent.
- MCP resources and prompts enter the composer only after an explicit Insert action.
- OAuth discovery accepts a single trailing-slash difference while keeping authorization responses exact.
- Importing libfx does not connect MCP, scan skills, spawn processes, or read files.
- Command output is escaped before reaching the model or terminal.
- Host-owned instructions are the complete libfx system context; libfx adds no hidden coding prompt.
- Browser sign-in reports success only after the credential is saved, and unusable refresh credentials are retired.
- libfx sends Agent network requests only through the host-provided fetch function.
- Inherited fx tracing settings no longer create unexpected libfx output or trace files.

- Resuming legacy sessions no longer restores old credential references or sends unfinished requests under unverified credentials.
- Internal subagent sessions stay out of latest-session selection.
- Conflicting provider tool records are rejected before execution.

## 0.0.7

**MCP is safer, easier to manage and more compatible; project servers require explicit trust, `fx mcp` is now a top-level command, `Enter` steers active turns and fx uses eight fewer tools to preserve context.**

### Breaking Changes

- **Model selection**: `/model` now handles the full selection flow, from quick choices to the complete catalog.
- **Fewer filesystem tools**: fx now advertises eight fewer tools for better accuracy and more context, with `terminal` handling core filesystem operations.

### New Features

- **Active-turn steering**: While fx is working, `Enter` steers the active turn at the next safe model boundary. If a tool is running, fx waits for it to finish; `Escape` interrupts the active work and applies the update as soon as the turn settles.
- **Collapsed tool calls**: `/settings` now includes `Collapse tool calls`, which shows one summary per tool-call group in the main transcript. Individual calls remain available in the full transcript with `Ctrl+O`.
- **Project MCP configuration**: Workspaces can now define project MCP servers in `.mcp.json` alongside profile servers.
- **Top-level MCP management**: `fx mcp` is now a top-level command with `add`, `list`, `path`, `remove`, `auth`, `logout`, and `trust`.
- **Capability discovery**: fx can now search installed skills and configured MCP tools together from a natural-language request, then load or select the exact match before use.
- **Passive MCP listings**: `fx mcp list` reports configuration and saved authentication without connecting to servers. Add `--connect` for live discovery and health checks.
- **Structured final output**: In `fx ask --json`, `output` contains all assistant Markdown and `final_output` contains only a completed final response. Interrupted, failed, and background turns return an empty `final_output`.
- **ACP session discovery**: ACP `session/list` now lists sessions across workspaces when `cwd` is omitted, includes saved titles, and paginates results in groups of 100.

### Improvements

- **Transcript visibility**: Menus now open inline, so the transcript stays visible while you browse.
- **Focused menus**: Menus now use category, scope, and provider filters to show more relevant options.
- **Usage visibility**: Usage data now loads without blocking the interface and tracks token and request totals without double counting.
- **MCP diagnostics**: `fx status` and `fx doctor` now report configured servers and project configuration errors without starting servers or loading credentials.
- **MCP profile compatibility**: `~/.fx/mcp.json` now accepts `mcpServers` as an alias for `mcp`, while every write uses `mcp`.
- **Live turn feedback**: Submitted prompts, turn progress, elapsed time, and token usage now stay visible throughout the turn.
- **Smoother response streaming**: Assistant output now appears in complete blocks instead of character by character.
- **Code blocks**: Code blocks now use solid horizontal rules instead of side rails, keeping language labels and copied source clean.
- **Subscription sign-in**: Sign-in stays clear and usable on compact terminals, while manual code entry appears only when needed.
- **Automatic reviews**: Automatic permission reviews now allow more time before reporting that review is unavailable.
- **System prompt overrides**: Command help now documents temporary system-prompt replacement while keeping tool, skill, project, and runtime context.

### Bug Fixes

- **Transcript stability**: Streaming responses no longer move scrollback or rewrite completed output.
- **Environment compatibility**: Interactive input now works correctly on WSL, and browser-hosted fx stops unsupported network work instead of retrying it.
- **Retry recovery**: Automatic retries now show progress, clear stale state, and stop silent Gateway attempts.
- **Terminal cleanup**: Timed-out and cancelled commands stop cleanly, keep accurate outcomes after resume, and avoid unsafe retries when completion cannot be confirmed.
- **Terminal recovery**: Sessions recover from host shutdown, accept input without a helper restart, and return control when the turn ends.
- **Saved tool output**: Saved results remain readable when a generated handle omits its file suffix.
- **MCP reliability**: MCP servers now start, stop, reconnect, and report errors more consistently across modern and legacy implementations.
- **Subagents and approvals**: Subagents keep their reasoning settings, and visible child approvals continue receiving input while the view refreshes.
- **ACP responses**: ACP clients receive clean Markdown, and resumed responses no longer repeat text already delivered.
- **Undo safety**: `/undo` now keeps the original file intact when a restore cannot be completed and refuses attempts redirected through a new symlink.

### Security

- **Signed macOS releases**: Stable macOS releases are now signed and notarized before packaging.
- **Project MCP protections**: Project servers and environment values remain inactive until approval, tool calls are checked again before reaching a server, and ambiguous configuration writes are refused.
- **MCP credentials**: Valid credentials remain usable across non-expiring tokens and macOS accounts without a default Keychain, while malformed or rejected credentials are reported correctly.

## 0.0.6

**New Gateway sessions use Kimi K3 with Fast mode, foreground commands require timeouts, auto mode reviews exact pending actions, and the macOS arm64 binary is 0.3% smaller (6.12 MiB vs 6.13 MiB).**

### Breaking Changes

- **Terminal presentation**: `/appearance`, `/input`, and `/maxxing` have been removed along with their saved settings. fx now uses the same input and transcript layout everywhere.
- **Foreground command timeouts**: `terminal.exec` calls now require `timeout_ms` between 1 millisecond and 10 minutes. Use `terminal.start` for services, watchers, GUI apps, and other long-running work.

### New Features

- **Remote MCP servers**: `/mcp add --transport http <name> <url>` now saves or replaces a remote Streamable HTTP server and reloads MCP immediately. The existing local stdio form is unchanged.
- **Retained command output**: Captured command output can now be read later with `read_tool_result`, including after a saved session resumes. With `--no-save`, output remains available until fx exits.

### Improvements

- **Auto mode review prompts**: Auto mode now uses fewer tokens when reviewing unresolved actions.
- **Native binary size**: The macOS arm64 binary is 0.3% smaller (6.12 MiB vs 6.13 MiB).
- **Gateway defaults**: New Gateway sessions now use Kimi K3 with Fast mode enabled by default.
- **Setup hub**: `/setup` now groups sign-in methods under Connections and shows the current provider, Vercel team, and credential source. Child screens return to the setup hub, and active sign-in controls remain visible in compact terminals.
- **Provider model preferences**: Gateway, Codex, and Grok now keep separate saved model selections, so switching providers no longer replaces another provider's preferred model.
- **Subscription session longevity**: Codex and Grok sessions remain usable beyond 64 consecutive requests.
- **Usage tracking**: Rejected completions no longer appear in usage tracking, and duplicate completion callbacks are recorded once.
- **MCP discovery**: MCP searches still find the selected tool when a request includes surrounding context, and another server's authentication failure no longer replaces an empty search result.
- **MCP authentication**: MCP authentication stays responsive while configuration reloads or logout is in progress, and pending authentication stops when MCP reloads or fx exits.
- **Linked skill errors**: Linked skill errors now distinguish an unavailable linked directory from an unreadable `SKILL.md` and explain whether to repair, remove, or authorize the link.
- **Live permission modes**: `Shift+Tab` permission-mode changes now apply to later tool calls in the current turn. Actions already in progress keep the mode under which they were admitted.
- **Tool action summaries**: Denied and deferred tool rows now show the actual command or target, and those details and denial labels survive session resume.

### Bug Fixes

- **Terminal resize**: Terminal resizing no longer leaves empty scrollback behind.
- **Subscription sign-in**: Codex and Grok sign-ins now survive unrelated, stalled, reset, or stale browser connections. Grok authorization codes can also be pasted when the browser cannot return to fx.
- **OAuth callback pages**: OAuth callbacks now show a completion or failure page after returning from the browser.
- **Nested rebuilds**: Interactive terminal helpers continue working after a nested rebuild replaces the fx binary on disk.
- **Terminal recovery**: fx recovery no longer pauses commands already running in tmux.
- **Terminal cancellation**: Terminal cancellation no longer reports failure when the command exits during cancellation.
- **MCP resource compatibility**: MCP resources and prompts no longer fail on servers that require their configured name.
- **MCP credential recovery**: MCP credentials with no advertised scopes remain usable after restart. Malformed stored entries no longer prevent valid servers from loading and are removed on the next successful credential write.
- **MCP stdio environments**: Configured MCP stdio environment variables now override inherited values without discarding the rest of the child environment.
- **Captured command failures**: Captured command output remains readable after timeout or cancellation. Output-capture failures now fail the tool call instead of returning an incomplete result.
- **Resumed review labels**: The `Safety caution` and `Review unavailable` labels now survive session resume.

### Security

- **Exact-action reviews**: Auto mode reviews each unresolved action against the current request and relevant results from the current turn. A clear review applies only to that exact unchanged action and is checked again before execution.
- **Blocked cautions**: Cautioned or unavailable actions remain blocked without opening a permission prompt or ending the turn.
- **Untrusted tool output**: Actions copied from untrusted tool output remain blocked unless the user's request independently authorizes them.
- **Current-branch pushes**: Explicit pushes to the current branch use the branch reported by the local Git checkout rather than repository text.
- **Provider recovery authority**: After restart, fx continues unfinished Codex or Grok work only for the account that started it. If that account cannot be verified, fx preserves completed work and sends nothing.
- **Sensitive command output**: Command output flagged as sensitive is not saved with the session, including secrets split across output chunks or oversized lines.
- **OAuth callback validation**: OAuth authorization denials and successes apply only when the callback state matches the active sign-in attempt, and Grok browser callbacks accept only the expected xAI origin.
- **MCP issuer validation**: MCP sign-in stops before exchanging a token or saving credentials when the authorization response comes from a different issuer than the server advertised.

## 0.0.5

### Breaking Changes

- **Host command execution:** Run approved captured, background, and monitor commands as ordinary host subprocesses, and retire sandbox configuration, status fields, and commands
- **Interactive provider switching:** Move provider selection to `/setup` and remove the `/provider` slash command while keeping the top-level `fx provider` command

### New Features

- **Terminal tab titles:** Label interactive tabs with the session or workspace and active model, keep them current across rename, resume, and model changes, and clear them on exit
- **Terminal activity:** Keep each command or shell attached to its terminal activity row through completion, distinguish graceful close from force close, and hide no-op `cd . &&` prefixes
- **Terminal action arguments:** Advertise only the fields relevant to the selected action and limit unsaved `fx ask` sessions to `terminal.exec`
- **Auto mode reads:** Run routine read-only commands and hardened Git inspection directly without automatic review
- **Automatic denial recovery:** Return destructive actions to the agent for replanning and finish repeated no-progress denials as normal assistant output instead of opening a permission prompt
- **One-off subagents:** Keep active one-off subagents visible, deliver one final result, and retire them after completion while leaving persistent subagents reusable
- **Startup preferences:** Show saved reasoning effort and Fast mode immediately while model capabilities load
- **Dev build identity:** Add the commit and `[dev]` marker to dev-channel welcome headers without changing stable release headers
- **MCP reload feedback:** Replace internal health details with concise server availability and recovery guidance
- **Help layout:** Keep command descriptions close to command names on wide terminals
- **Native binary size:** Reduce the macOS arm64 release footprint while preserving existing behavior
- **Stable upgrades:** Restore forward-only version ordering across manual, automatic, and Ctrl+G upgrades

### Bug Fixes

- **Oversized images:** Normalize large macOS image snapshots without changing the originals and reject attachments locally when a bounded snapshot cannot be prepared
- **Corrupt memory stores:** Report malformed, oversized, or unreadable stores and preserve their original bytes instead of overwriting them
- **Non-regular file reads:** Reject FIFOs and other non-regular `read_file` targets before they can block
- **Malformed tool loops:** End a turn after three consecutive malformed-only tool batches and reset recovery after a valid batch
- **Terminal null placeholders:** Treat textual `"null"` values as absent for unused terminal fields while preserving real command text that contains the word
- **Terminal keyboard input:** Ignore unknown completed escape sequences and handle Ghostty kitty Escape reports with Caps Lock, Num Lock, and event suffixes
- **Credential fallback:** Continue to a stored API key when saved `fx login` credentials cannot load or refresh while keeping the login failure available for diagnostics
- **Vision recovery:** Retry replay-safe requests once after a post-Vision assistant-prefill rejection
- **Thinking status:** Keep the Thinking indicator and elapsed timer visible while automatic command review runs
- **Terminal helper compatibility:** Reject unsupported start, signal, and force-close requests from stale terminal helpers without losing unrelated sessions
- **WASM project context:** Skip unavailable local project-instruction probes in browser hosts while preserving host-supplied context
- **Idle terminal traffic:** Stop polling the terminal theme while idle and continue retinting after supported theme notifications

### Security

- **Command approval patterns:** Restrict wildcard command allows to static shell words and keep destructive shell commands and file deletion outside automatic review
- **macOS login storage:** Store native `fx login` sessions in Keychain with verified migration, refresh, restart, and logout behavior
- **MCP configuration writes:** Save `~/.fx/mcp.json` atomically with private permissions, reject linked targets, and preserve the previous configuration when a write fails
- **MCP session retirement:** Keep retired HTTP session IDs alive until in-flight requests drain
- **Provider response limits:** Reject oversized Codex and Grok catalogs, streams, tool data, and replay state while keeping later input usable
- **ACP permission validation:** Validate permission input before writing JSON-RPC frames

## 0.0.4

### New Features

- **Session resume command:** Resume the latest workspace session or an exact session ID with `fx session resume`
- **Headless permission prompts:** Add `--prompt-permissions` so JSON and quiet `fx ask` runs can request Y/N approval on a TTY while keeping stdout clean

### Improvements

- **Auto mode permissions:** Run routine reversible development commands and new-file creation directly, then ask for human approval after repeated automatic review denials
- **Command discovery:** Rank exact, prefix, and substring slash-command matches and highlight the selected help description
- **Terminal attention bells:** Emit one terminal bell when fx pauses for permission or other input so terminal multiplexers can flag waiting panes
- **Transcript scrollback:** Preserve retained transcript rows in native scrollback across pruning, resize, and reflow

### Bug Fixes

- **Session cache contention:** Continue same-workspace session writes and keep listing and resume results current while another process holds the latest-session cache lock
- **Reasoning effort settings:** Change reasoning effort without crashing or replacing the selected model
- **Web redirects:** Follow HTTP 303 redirects in `web_fetch`
- **Command output separation:** End command output that lacks a trailing newline before rendering the next `fx ask` tool header
- **Skill discovery:** Show one entry for skills reached through symlinked compatibility roots while preserving distinct same-name skills
- **libfx session transitions:** Cancel active cooperative turns before starting a fresh session so the terminal remains responsive
- **Memory activity:** Present `memory list` as a read instead of a write
- **Unsupported login shells:** Fall back to zsh on macOS or Bash elsewhere when the configured login shell is unsupported
- **Process cleanup:** Cancel and reap headless terminal commands on SIGTERM, preserve signal status, and tolerate short-lived Linux processes disappearing during cleanup
- **Model output limits:** Omit invalid limits that consume a model's full context window
- **Terminal lease transitions:** Reject write payloads on lease acquisition, release, and revocation before session state changes

## 0.0.3

### Improvements

- **JSON recovery progress:** Report retry, recovery, and safety-pause status on stderr during `fx ask --json` while keeping stdout parseable
- **Notification sounds:** Use clearer 48 kHz AAC cues with full tails and the intended volume differences between actions

### Bug Fixes

- **Memory clearing:** Succeed when memory is already absent, but report real deletion failures instead of claiming memories were cleared
- **Background URLs:** Refuse `/background open` for stopped or stale tasks so saved URLs cannot open an unrelated process after port reuse
- **Model catalogs:** Reject malformed catalog responses with a nonzero exit instead of treating them as an empty model list
- **Skill creation:** Show invalid `/skills create` names inline and keep the current session, transcript, and composer usable
- **GLM 5.2 responses:** Restore responses for fx login sessions without changing requests for other models

## 0.0.2

### New Features

- **Unified terminal execution:** Run captured foreground commands and durable interactive sessions through the `terminal` tool, with the user's shell profile loaded by default and `clean` as an explicit opt-out
- **Saved session permissions:** Store exact allow or deny rules with `/permissions remember`, list them by stable ID, and remove them with `/permissions revoke`
- **MCP server awareness:** Show the agent the configured server aliases, availability, and visible tool counts so it can find and use MCP capabilities

### Improvements

- **Auto mode recovery:** Let the agent revise its plan after denied, timed-out, or invalid reviews and return a tools-disabled response after repeated blocks instead of stalling for approval
- **Trusted auto mode actions:** Allow bounded reads, hardened read-only Git commands, and prepared workspace edits to proceed without extra review while keeping ambiguous or sensitive actions gated
- **MCP connection reliability:** Connect to legacy stdio servers, cancel stalled reloads, and report the required `oauth.issuer` override when issuers do not match
- **MCP failure handling:** Show concise server errors and stop a third matching failed call before it runs
- **Terminal action recovery:** Reject invalid terminal fields before running anything and return one complete correction without repeating the same repair loop
- **Fast mode defaults:** Start new sessions with `zai/glm-5.2` without enabling Fast mode while preserving explicit preferences and `/fast`

### Bug Fixes
